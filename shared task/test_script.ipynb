Conflict among peers is something I really struggle with, especially in situations as this one. Since I was the chairman, I had to remain neutral on the one hand, while on the other hand also making this conflict does not remain unresolved. Because of this friction, I had decided to conduct a small informal meeting in which both members could talk things out and I had to moderate their conversation. As a result of this conversation, both members could see eye to eye again and the fiction did not expand into something worse. This was one of the first times in which I had to moderate a discussion between two friends and both were relieved that I took the time to focus on their well-being.', 'I learned one of the most important lessons in management because of a mistake I made. As a chairman, you often have to deal with unexpected challenges. One time, another board member had made a mistake which resulted in us having to postpone an event. This person did not fit in very well in the group and I did not want to ostracize them any further, so I decided to make up another excuse, because of which the event could continue as planned. Later on, other board members had found out why the event had to be cancelled and that I had kept the real reason a secret from them. Even though the other members appreciated and understood why I hesitated to tell them, they made sure to let me know that I should always be honest with them and I had to apologise. Because of this, I learned that honesty and openness are key values in managing an organisation, even if you are afraid to do so. Until this day, I still give this advice to my succeeders.', \"Because I was a board member of a student organisation, there have been numerous occasions in which I got a group of people together. Most of the times, this went rather flawlessly, since I already knew the group of people I had to work with because we are part of the same organisation. But one time, I had to plan an event together with some other organisations and I was the head responsible for this event. So I organised some mutual meetings in which we all came together, I delegated the work load between the different organisations and kept track of their progress. This was a real valuable experience for me, because I also had to take into account other organisations' work habits and make sure that everyone did what they were supposed to do and that they were on time. Luckily, everyone was very proud of the end result and the event was very successful.\"]...\n",

Once, there was quite a big miscommunication issue with the money we ask parents for summer camp. Some co-leaders had sent an unfinished draft of the camp invitation to the parents, in which the price for camp was way too low. This resulted in plenty of parents not paying enough. The leaders in this situation only realized their mistake when camp was already on its way, and they did not have enough money to provide food for the entire camp. They contacted me with the question of what they should do. Of course, it is annoying to ask parents for more money when they have already sent their kids to us. Communication with parents had never been a strong skill of mine, but now I had no choice but to contact them all with a difficult question. I decided the best we could do was own up our mistake, show the parents we would try and solve it ourselves but also let them know that they could still help. We crafted some baskets with snacks and crafts with the kids and went to sell them on the streets close to our camp location, but also let the parents know they could reserve some for after camp was over. They would pay in advance, and get the basket upon return of their kids. This way, we did not have to straight up ask more money from the parents, but gave them something in return and also made it into something fun for the kids.', 'When I failed my first exam, I felt like giving up. In high school I was not used to failing and always got pretty solid grades. When I came to university, my first exam period I failed one exam. Everyone told me that it was okay, it happens to everyone, there is no shame. However, I was very disappointed in myself and felt like I really did not try hard enough. It made me doubt whether I made the correct choice of study. When the second semester started, though, the fear to feel like this again boosted me to work harder. It forced me to learn how to study, and it gave me new motivation. I learned that failure can slow me down and make me want to quit, but I can also change the mindset around it and have it give me a boost.', 'For this I would go back to scouts. Last year a lot of my friends quit and a lot of new people became leader. Two groups formed itself. The people who had been leaders a while and who were closest with the ones who just quit, and the people who just became a scoutsleader and did not have any connection yet to the already-leaders. My job as head leader was to bring them together. I tried organizing teambuildings and invited all of them for drinks a couple of times. However, the people of a group would always sit together and have their own conversations. Eventually I decided to organize a BBQ at our scouts, and I put namecards for everyone on a chair. It forced them to sit next to people they did not really know and forced them to find things to talk about, otherwise it would be a boring BBQ. The BBQ was a success, they all talked, new friend groups were forming and now, a year later, you cannot see the two separate groups anymore.']...\n",

One of it's key aspects is the inevitable confrontation with language conflict. Even if you speak a bit of language, encountering and interacting with the locals will remain challenging. These situations have made me more adaptable, more receptive to what words and explanations are more easily understood. One of the ways to overcome this barrier was getting to know the key cultural concepts or elements that people from a specific country/region/city know, may it be a specific word, a song, a movie, a saying, random fact about the local football team - all these things seem to create a connection, as it shows that you care and are curious about the people surrounding you.\", \"I have recently started volunteering at a cultural center in which my tasks include bartending. I have no previous experience of bartending and the majority of visitors speak a language that I do not know. Even when I applied for this position I knew that I will inevitably makes mistakes, just as one always does when starting a new thing. During my first shifts, I miscalculated prices, poured drinks to the wrong cups, had to deal with foamy and fussy beers and had to learn how to deal with less satisfied visitors.This experience, together with many other volunteering opportunities that I had done in the past, mainly taught to not be afraid of making mistakes, as it is the only way to learn. Additionally, I have noticed is that in such instances, I always have to slow myself down, calm my mind and pay attention to what I am doing, this way not letting the stress in and helping me learn and perform better. Finally and perhaps most importantly, the place and the people determine the actual experience and it's perception. If you are in a good place, that is welcoming and understanding, where you feel appreciated, you are less likely to make mistakes and even if you do, the lesson will be learned much more quickly.\", \"Perhaps the most challenging leadership role I had to take on was becoming a curator for my previous university's student representations group. My task included finding students who would represent their courses and would try to improve the study experience in the meetings with professors. The main issue I encountered the initial fear of reaching out to people and the perception of my role itself. The student group I was in, was often acting as a very bureaucratic entity that would not make any impactful change and I felt that some of the students had the same view of me. Although that probably was the case, this experience was very important for my change, for improving my organizational skills and ultimately helping me overcome the fear of contacting and talking to strangers. While I was also critical of my organization's approach, ultimately the efforts were worth it, as representation remains more important than some systemic flaws.\"]...\n",

When starting my PhD this of course was a crucial part of how to share research with peers. So I really had to come outside my comfort zone. I tried to overcome my nerves for this by prepping very thoroughly in advance. In the notes section of the powerpoint slides I wrote out word for word what I wanted to say. Once I had my text I practiced it out loud multiple times over to know most of it by hart and to sound fluent in what I wanted to say.

So for me this felt like I failed. The reviewers of the journal are very strict. The feedback I got was critical but very elaborate. With some of the feedback I agreed, with other parts I found the reviewers were nagging about little thinks or made mistakes themselves. To tackle the problem I asked for an extended deadline and continued working on the article to make it better and process all the different feedback I got. In the end the article was accepted though I still need to make some very small changes. I learned from this experience that sometimes getting an article published can be difficult, at other times it goes more smoothly. I also learned it is important to persevere even when something is difficult.

The issues related mainly to people taking a while in answering the poll not very quickly. The fact that some people did not show up, has to do with the priorities they set, and this is not something that I could solve to letting everyone come together.

However, I knew that the people who owned the horse did not live closeby, but I also did not know who these people were or where they lived. I was faced with the issue of having to find help without knowing where to start. I decided to phone a veterinary doctor from my village and asked if he knew the people who owned the horse. He told me he did not, but he did know the previous owners of the field. That way I was able to call several people and eventually found the owner. The horse was brought to the veterinary doctor that same day. I could have given up immediately because I did not know the owners, and most people I called could not directly help me.

However, last year, the subject matter of one of my exams was completely new for me, and I realised that I did not foresee enough time to study for this exam at all.

Since I attended all of my classes, some of the subject matter was already quite clear to me, but there were some parts that remained difficult. Therefore, I decided it would be best to dedicate as much time as possible to thoroughly understanding the parts I was struggling with, and to spend little time on the parts I felt more comfortable with, trusting I would remember what I needed from my classes. I went to the exam without studying or understanding everything I needed to. Nevertheless, I was able to pass the exam by taking the risk of only focusing on the parts I did not understand, and by believing in myself for the other parts.

After realising this and with a deadline quickly approaching, I asked my group members to come together to discuss how we could solve our problems. We found that we all had very different talents when it came to doing academic research, but combining these talents we could come to a nice end product. For instance, the working student had a talent for Excel, from his experience in the workfield. He took it upon himself to do the necessary calculations for our research. The international student was good at presenting, so she took on a larger part of the presentation. While I do not like presenting, I do enjoy doing the research for and writing essays. Therefore, I focused mostly on the essay that we needed to hand in before our presentation. This way, everyone was able to focus on the parts of the project they felt most comfortable with.']...\n",

Secondly, I accepted my status as a complete beginner and took it more as a challenge for myself than a duty to perform for others.

I had remained in passive inaction until there was no way out. Additionally to the relatively cheap repair, I had to pay a very expensive investigation fee. Still, the money was nothing compared to the harm done to my self-image. I regret to this day that I lied instead of just admitting to the excusable mistake I made.

I can't really pinpoint what it was that made me so anxious, since all of my friends were quite reliable. I think it was the challenge of thinking about multiple things at once, setting priorities and fear of forgetting something. The party itself was a great experience for everyone, but I wish I could have freed myself of the anxiety.\"]...\n",

At the health insurance fund I worked at as a counselor, it was for example strictly forbidden to communicate any document via a way that was not previously 'confirmed' by the client on a paper form, or via a platform that used Itsme. Of course, there are good reasons for such a rule, but it became a bit embarrassing when it prevented people from helping their sick co-workers or even loved ones by slowing down the whole bureacratic process yet again, even more so when these people really were dependent on the allowance they ought to receive from the fund. This is a rule I have made mistakes against once or twice.

This quirky woman in her fifties was chaotic, often doing five things at the same time without finishing any, chattering away with guests when there was work to be done. Her behaviour frustrated the other personnel, so they put her on the dishes which forced her to keep her mind to one thing, which in turn infuriated her. When she was collecting used coffee grounds which she would take home to grow mushrooms on, the rest made fun of her. Bad vibe.  When I was working, I tried to calm the tempers. When others were making nasty comments behind her back, I tried to rephrase their - usually justified - frustrations in a constructive way to her: I pointed out things she had forgotten with a wink. I also set aside used coffee grounds for her, so she wouldn't lose time with it, and so it became less something to be made fun of.

I remembered that biologists deal with a very similar question regarding species diversity within ecosystems and followed that train of thought. Reading up on it lead me to the \\'species diversity index\\' which was formulated by Claude Shannon, the father of information theory. It was a concise and elegant formula which included both the number of inter- and intra-species individuals in the calculation. When I used the formula its results confirmed the hypothesis. Looking back on it later I figured the idea was probably to use a measure of dispersion which we had seen in class, but I still think my solution was quicker and just as applicable to the question.', \"When I was a kid I used to play harpsicord. I didn't really enjoy it as I do the piano now, but it did teach me some valuable lessons looking back on it. My teacher would always say that when I made a mistake, I should rewind and play it again, at a steady pace, but much, much slower. I always wanted to rush ahead and finally get it right, or play the parts I knew well fast and the ones I struggled with slowly. I think this strategy applies any time you face a problem. Go over it again slowly, but keep a steady pace. That way the correct procedure gets inculcated in your brain instantly and you don't teach yourself the wrong thing. It's kind of like ironing out a crinkle.\", \"It's rather banal but I helped some friends construct furniture from Ikea. I quickly took over the project as was evident by the fact that the manual was in my hands. We were constructing several pieces at once with multiple people so it was important to segment the parts and for me to delegate some other preparatory task to whomever was done with their previous work so as not to have any idlers. I also ensured a safe workspace for everyone by putting bottles of beer and expensive vases out of the way. One issue I encountered was that when the workload became low towards the end, the need for a manager vanished and we were back to slow but sociable toiling. The result was some perfectly well assembled Ikea furniture in record time but also the unionization of my workforce.\"]...\n",

I am a host of cocktail workshops, and if working in the service industry teaches you one thing, it's that you should never underestimate the extent to which a customer can test you patience. We work with a very strict schedule, leaving no time between groups. Recently, one group arrived late, 15 minutes to be exact, having only booked an hour long slot. They spent the following 15 minutes complaining about how their experience would be rushed, and about the selection of cocktails, which they demanded to be able to alter, but which has been set by the manager with whom they made the appointment in advance. After assuaging the guests to the extent I could manage, I proposed them a different cocktail menu that would adapt to their preferences, and would require minimal work in changing the setup that had been prepared for them on my part. To make sure the previous group didn't have to suffer from this group's tardiness and general lack of decorum, I got the instructions for the workshop out of the way in the remaining time allotted to us, and then opened up the courtyard (usually not open to guests), so they could finish their drinks at their leisure without encumbering other guests any further.\", \"The mistakes I make are most frequently attributed to a single but persistent character flaw of mine, which is my tendency to take on too much at once.

The Gameboy had probably not been used for over a decade and when I tried to boot it up, it would not turn on. I did not want to buy another one just to play a single game. Thus, even though I had absolutely zero experience when it came to fixing electronics, I decided to try fixing it myself. I spent my next Saturday looking up information on forums and watching YouTube videos to get more information on the subject and after disassembling the Gameboy, I figured out that the problem was some corrosion damage on the motherboard. This ended up being a pretty simple fix for which I just needed some vinegar and rubbing alcohol. Nonetheless, I felt pretty proud when the Gameboy worked again and am planning to learn how to solder soon to fix more complex problems in the future. I am not sure if this counts as a 'creative' solution, but it was a great example of a problem outside of my comfort zone and it showed me that tackling those problems is a great opportunity to learn new skills.\", 'When I was a kid I used to participate in a lot of chess tournaments. I would perform really well in the smaller tourneys and often win trophies, but when it came to the more important ones, such as regional or national tournaments, I would often get stressed about performing well enough and put too much pressure on myself to win. Of course, this had a negative effect on how I played during those tournaments. After a while I did not look forward toward my chess matches as much as I used to. It was at that point that I realised that the most important thing about a hobby is to enjoy yourself instead of always trying to succeed. Since then, I always prioritised having fun with my hobbies, which includes chess, and it also caused me to pick up more hobbies and skills because it no longer bothered me if I made mistakes or was bad at them when I just started. Usually, by not putting too much pressure on yourself to avoid failure, you will gradually start to improve anyway since you will spend more time on a hobby when you enjoy it more.

A few months ago however, I needed to cycle to a train station ca. 10 kilometres from my home to catch a train. It's my usual stroll, but I left earlier than on a regular day. So I decided to take the long way round, cycling through a forest which - while being a detour - was according to my grandmother a faster way to the station. In normal conditions it's connection mainly existing of dirt roads till the nearby town center without any significant traffic.   First I did not have much of luck, the dirt road was unstable due to rain. With a big drive on my wheels, I managed to get through till I reached the centre of a forest consisting mainly of pine trees and sand dunes. There I stumbled on foresters cutting trees who blocked the entire road, and their vehicles also cut off any sidepaths. I looked for any path out. I tried getting through the thick shrubbery, but that was impassible. And going back was almost not an option, I needed to catch my train. The only way was up! Up the sand dune, but biking there was not an option because I kept slipping away. Like a professional cyclist I carried my heavy bike up my sholders till I reached the top of the dune.   However, when I got there, the other side of the dune was blocked by a big wooden fence. Only people on foot could easily pass it. I tried to get my bike through the pedestrian hatch, but it was not possible. Time was ticking, so I threw my bike over the fence. There I discovered that on the other side there was a natural/cultural heritage site which had been damaged by other bikers, which was the cause of the fence. To not damage the heritage, I carried my bike on my sholder down. In the end getting just in time in the station. Arriving simultaniously.   What I learned there is that you have to look for what your environment offers and limits when getting a solution. There was a way out, but I had to reason fast to reach my goals.\", \"When I was in high school I had to speech in front of 200 kids. This was to introduce them to the Student Council. However, I barely prepared this. No idea of what I was going to say or do.   So I had to leave class earlier to get to the big room full of potential new students. When I arrived there the doors were locked. It hit me that the principal and I did not talk about how I should get in. I heard them calling my name, while I was stuck behind the door. I knocked on the door so that they would notice that they forgot to leave it open for me. When I finally got in, there was something else I did not know. How the hell should I go on the stage? There were stairs, but they did not have a straightforward path to the backstage. So I tried to climb through a plant that was standing on stage. For clarification, the plant was standing on the side of the stage where the stairs were, so I just thought it blocked the usual enterance.   So I was there on the stage, but did not know what to say. I tried to be funny, like a stand up comedian, but all my bad takes fell on deaf ears. I started to explain what the Student Council was doing, but kept repeating the same stuff and was not coherent. The students in the room were chuckleing and laughing at my performance of unprepairedness. Finally I left the stage, while the next teacher passsed me and made remarks of mild dissapointment.   In the end, it was the best thing that could ever happen to me. Before all this I had major presentation anxiety. I often turned blue and shaked uncontrollably. After this, it was all gone. All of those things that went wrong in the moment, did not matter in the bigger picture. People did not mind that I failed there as a junior student, it was understandable in that moment. The students even loved it, having comments for the remainder of my high school carreer about the speech.   If I had prepared myself a bit more and stayed true to myself I could have made a better performance and it wouldn't have costed me a lot more of my time. Having fear for presenting stuff was not necessary, because mistakes happen all the time and with a bit more preparation I could've easily managed to fill in blank spots. I learned that with subtle changes, I could be flexible. I just needed to try stuff and dare to take the stage. And I did, participating more and taking the lead in conversations. Failing is often not that bad, if it is not with ill-intent off course. To prevent more logistic failures in the future, like the door or stage enterance, the realization came that communication with higher up was key.\", \"Once upon a time I had to create a guided tour through a Greek city I had never been before for an university course.   We were assigned a group of four, but the other students in my group were work students who did not expect to take the lead in the group. So we devided the tasks with me as a main spokesperson for the group because I was always present. Two people, nice people by the way, wanted to do it on their own terms and only communicate through mail. This was not handy, but I complied because resistance to their stance was futile and wouldn't benefit our end goal.  I said that we all should look for city highlights and list them, and I would make a tour and devide the different stops among all students to give a little talk. Not only this, but because the larger group had someone with a mobile disability  - in a not so equipped city - we needed to make sure that our route was accessible for all. Everyone had to make their own texts which would be checked by the other group members two weeks in advance. This to encourage an early start to the project and a sense of individual and shared responsibility. In a shared document we could leave remarks and tips for eachother, which was faster than sending an endless stream of mails. And we made sure that we encorporated a few themes throughout our tour.  While there were some difficulties due to certain wants, needs and differences in schedule, we managed to find multiple ways to keep the conversation going. There was a certain speed, ease of communication among the group members that was kept with respect to eachothers situation. The only thing I would do different now is to communicate more with the other groups in parallel. Some groups wanted to do the same landmarks and we missed a major one because the communication between the other groups lacked. But internally we managed to figure out what was optimal for us, which gained a more than decent urban tour in the end.\"]...\n",

However, since only the final grade (all individual scores added up) counted for all of us, we all failed, even though individually we (the other team members) passed, because of that one member we didn't get over 50% of the points, and everyone had to redo their work... it was a real bummer, and it made me realize that I need to be more vocal when I see someone is slacking off, especially if the end result affects the whole team.\"]...\n",

As a result I went to the city and spend a few days to get similar to area. After that it made things easier when I met with group who does not know place much and helping them commute and shopping I started to socialize easier then others. Well rested and experienced with the city I shared my knowledge and guide new comers help me gain the trust of the group easily. It was very simple. I came to city before anyone else, analyzed and learned so I was more comfortable when social interactions started.', 'I think the reason with my mistake is I underestimated I was in a different country so a different culture. As a result language barrier and communication caused me a wrong decision of buying a product. I managed to fix it being creative by asking others for their domain expertise and keep the communication in a calm manner. Refund was no option but I managed to get a new product -simply they have changed the product with new one - by following the steps and being patient and reasonable. There were no magic. I followed the process, ask for domain expertise from my colleagues and put this in practice with a calm attitude was more than enough to solve me issue.', 'Most of the time I am very good at choosing my group because I get my connections earlier than most of the people around so I can have people to do a group study for the further tasks. However there are teams that randomly created by a superior that I may need to work with people and have no control over who they can be. When finding myself in kind of a situations I always keep calm and serious. I am open minded and I do not have anxiety. This helps me to discuss any subject with my team or a member who is not cooperating. Professional relationships are different than daily interactions. Underlining this and communicating for the problems in this setting helped me to solve the conflict. I also have a good way of interpreting problems to the supervisors, without complaining about team members, and following their advise worked efficiently for me.']...\n",

We were supposed to do a cheese and wine evening, everything was in order, from the bread to the cheese to the wine. One of the most important elements of that evening, which was not yet fixed, was the location. The responsible person notified me the day this event was supposed to take place, which was on a Sunday. Without a location, the event would fail completely. In that instance, I used my connection and reputation that I have, and I called someone and pleaded if we could use his location. This was tricky because it was too late for him to find personnel to supervise the event, and therefore I had to plead that I was very responsible and that I would ensure that everything would be cleaned and in its place after the event. By doing this, I was able to save an event that otherwise would have not been able to go through.', 'One of the biggest mistakes that I made happened during the same function as in the previous question. As the chairman of the student club, I always felt a great deal of responsibility. Because I was the final person who was responsible, I felt like I should always keep control. As leadership of this club, we were a team of three people. While both were competent and in no sense lazy, I did feel that I was supposed to be the one who was in control and ended up doing all the work. This kept on going for quite a while. My school results started to go down, and my personal life slowly stared to become nonexistent. When finally my body physically started to fail as well, I finally reached the breaking point.  What I learned from this experience is that while it is always good to believe in yourself, you should always keep in mind where your limits are and be ready to ask for help when you need it. There is no shame in asking for help, and sometimes it is even necessary. I learned to safeguard my personal boundaries better and learned to figure out my priorities.', 'As chairman of the student club, leading a team was what was expected from my position. Leading a diverse group of people learned me many things. One of the biggest things I learned was that each has their own abilities and strengths. I had members in my team who needed only one question, and they went to work. They would do their own work very well without needing a lot of follow up. The problem here was that as individuals, they worked very well on their own, but lacked team spirit. On the other hand, there were people who worked very well as a team, but they needed a lot of guidance, and it was necessary for me to follow up their work, or it would not be done. The combination of these two types did create situations where I and my two other colleagues of the leadership had to step in and do extra work.  Eventually, the vice-chairman and I learned that we should tend more to the personal needs of the team in combination of the needs of the team as a whole. By encouraging the people who needed guidance and having the individuals tell the group more about their personal work we ensured that productivity increased and that we were able to organize a broad scale of events with which we were able to make a great amount of people happy.']...\n",

Mailing invitations are a thing of the past and I am not fond of making groupchats to communicate the details of the event as they have proven to be not very useful in the past, and frankly, that is a bit impersonal. Not only am I not comfortable calling 70+ people, I simply also couldn't fit it in my schedule. The age range is also quite big, not everyone remembers everything correctly, etc. My biggest problem: I cannot ask for people to buy a gift (while I do expect it). So my solution was to create a jazzy invitation on Canva with all the details: date, location, dress code, what time guests should be arriving and what time my mother would arrive, and lastly gift ideas. I simply put some pictograms so the options seem broad but also not demanding. Texting everyone a picture of an invitation made my job as organiser a lot easier and less time-consuming.\", 'When I was 17, I was panicking about what I should study at university. I had a big A0 sheet on my bedroom wall with all the possible majors I could study, each accompanied with a pros and cons list. Well, when I finally enrolled in college, I chose something completely different from my \"major\" in high school. I went from STEM to Humanities, much to my family\\'s dismay. And I failed that year. I struggled too much with college life. So I moved back home and enrolled in college there. This time I chose for something that I knew I was skilled in: sciences. But then the pandemic rolled around and I realised that still wasn\\'t what I wanted to do. Though I was skilled enough (and got better grades), my passion was in the Humanities. And then I changed universities again. After four long years I finally finished my bachelor\\'s degree. What I learned from this experience is that sometimes it is okay to give up, take a step back, breathe, and start anew. I also learned to deal with my insecurities of being older than my coeds because everyone comes from different life paths.', \"I had a group project with a group of seven people. Seven people is simply too much for a project, especially when you have different motivations for said project. Half of the group was passionate about the project and the other half just wanted to get a passing grade. Even though, I don't like taking leading roles because I know myself to be a perfectionist which gets really annoying with people, I took the initiative to oversee everyone's work. Firstly, I asked what role they would prefer to fulfil and then I divided the tasks. There were three mini groups which each had their mini leader that reported to me. In the end, I fixed all the issues and polished the raw edges myself. Although I took on a large proportion of the work, it was fulfilling. The result was outstanding. So much so that the professor used our project as an example for the rest of the class.\"]...\n",

My coworker, who had been in charge of delegating tasks to others,  could not help out as she was fully booked with other engagements. I assume she hd forgotten to ask anyone specifically to make the cover art and the rest of the team that was in charge of the final arrangement, had tried to make a cover based on another drawing in the magazine but remained unhappy with the result. They then asked me to help out. The problem was that there was only one day for me to make a cover, which was not supposed to be my responsibility otherwise, so I tried to tink of a solution that would be quick and easy but would still look good. In the end, I combined multiple drawings from articles together and added some extra details to make a coherent whole image.

As I did not understand what was being asked of me, I told the coworker to ask another person, who I thought was responsible for managing the credit of the articles on the website. Later on, this other person came forward to discuss this issue with me and as she explained what needed to be changed I also realised that that changing the credit (in this case) was my responsibility. I apologised to this other person for the confusion and changed the credits on the website accordingly.

I restarted the conversation in the group chat to give ideas for presents and lead the group into choosing an appropriate present. I then also delligated which members of the group would be buying which parts of the gift and checked in at later times to see if they had done their part.

I\\'ve never been good at livening up the atmosphere, but as the \"host\" that day I felt that I was obliged to.

When we were leaving, we had to catch a bus and time was rather tight. When we arrived at Roosevelt Square, it was almost the scheduled time and I hurried everyone to hop on the only bus that was there, fearing that we would miss our trip. But as the bus crossed the border and entered the Netherlands, we realized that it wasn't going to our destination, Brussels. As I checked online, I found out that all the buses were a bit delayed and we got on the wrong bus because I didn't check its number or ask the driver to make sure. Consequently, we had to get off at Eindhoven and spend the whole day and a lot of money on trains that could get us back on track. From this experience, I learned not to panic even when time is tight, not to take anything for granted, and always double-check before taking any actions.\", \"I worked in a student organization and once we were holding a New Year's party for exchange students.
